Android App -  Tarot Card Reading
Summary of idea: A tarot reading application that replicates the experience of having your tarot cards read without having a physical deck.  Baseline idea is to make the user sign in, and give them one free reading per day.  Allow additional readings after watching reward ad video.
Reading will consist of 3 cards drawn randomly from a deck of tarot cards, and accompanying explanation of the meaning of each card.


What problem or pain point does it solve: Traditional Tarot card readings require a physical deck and somebody with knowledge of the meaning of the cards. A mobile application can pre-store information about Tarot making it more accessible to more people.  Additionally, we would have the capability to integrate AI to generate fresh interpretations of card groupings if desired.


Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition:
User Interface (UI): Simple and intuitive design that allows users to shuffle and draw cards.
Reading Display: Showcase the three drawn cards with their associated interpretations.
Basic User Profiles: Allow users one free reading per day after signing in, additional readings through reward ads.  Stretch goal of allowing users to visit past readings.
Index section that allows users to read pre-stored meanings of any possible Tarot card.
